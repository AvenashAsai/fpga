# ThePongGame


This is a simple PONG Game that is written in SystemVerilog by OGUZ KAAN AGAC and BORA ECER as a CS223 Final Project of the Bilkent University

The clk_wiz_0 block is provided by Xilinx. Instead of using a clock counter to be more precise we used Vivadoâ€™s own clk API clk_wiz_0. https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/clocking_wizard.html
  
Sync_mod block is translated from another source, originally it was VHDL, it has translated into System Verilog. 
Original source code is from Jan Bukowski of http://mikrokontroler.pl/
