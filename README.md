[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/r8tnSQvCtVk/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/r8tnSQvCtVk)

Our project is a two-player pong game created on BASYS-3 using the VGA output of the BASYS3. 
Project is coded in System Verilog and VHDL using VIVADO IDE. 

Top player controls are the up and down button on the boad and bottom player uses the left and right buttons and middle button is used to start the round. 

Current Scores are displayed on the seven segment display of the Basys board.
